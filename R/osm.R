#' Ordinal data regression using the Ordered Stereotype Model (OSM).
#'
#' Fit a regression model to an ordered factor response. The model is NOT a
#' logistic or probit model because the link function is not the logit, but the
#' link function is log-based.
#'
#' This function should be used in a very similar way to \code{MASS::polr}, and
#' some of the arguments are the same as \code{polr}, but the ordinal model used
#' here is less restrictive in its assumptions than the proportional odds model.
#' However, it is still parsimonious i.e. it uses only a small number of
#' additional parameters compared with the proportional odds model.
#'
#' @param formula a formula expression as for regression models, of the form
#'   response ~ predictors. The response should be a factor (preferably an
#'   ordered factor), which will be interpreted as an ordinal response, with
#'   levels ordered as in the factor. The model must have an intercept: attempts
#'   to remove one will lead to a warning and be ignored. An offset may be used.
#'   See the documentation of formula for other details.
#'
#' @param data a data frame, list or environment in which to interpret the
#'   variables occurring in \code{formula}.
#'
#' @param weights optional case weights in fitting. Default to 1.
#'
#' @param start initial values for the parameters. See the Details section for
#'   information about this argument.
#'
#' @param ... additional arguments to be passed to optim, most often a control
#'   argument.
#'
#' @param subset expression saying which subset of the rows of the data should
#'   be used in the fit. All observations are included by default.
#'
#' @param na.action a function to filter missing data.
#'
#' @param Hess logical for whether the Hessian (the observed information matrix)
#'   should be returned.
#'
#' @param model logical for whether the model matrix should be returned.
#'
#' @details This model is the \emph{ordered stereotype} model (Anderson 1984,
#' Agresti 2010)
#'
#' It is more flexible than the proportional odds model but only adds a handful
#' of additional parameters. It is not a cumulative model, being instead defined
#' in terms of the relationships between each of the higher categories and the
#' lowest category that is treated as the reference category.
#'
#' Each of the higher categories has its own intercept term, mu_k, which is
#' similar to the zeta parameters in \code{polr}, but in the OSM each higher
#' category also has its own scaling parameter, phi_k, which adjusts the effect
#' of the covariates on the response. This allows the effect of the covariates
#' on the response to be slightly different for each category of the response,
#' thus making the model more flexible than the proportional odds model.
#'
#' The final set of parameters are coefficients for each of the covariates, and
#' these are equivalent to the coefs in \code{polr}. Higher or more positive
#' values of the coefficients increases the probability of the response being in
#' the higher categories, and lower or more negative values of the coefficients
#' increase the probability of the response being in the lower categories.
#'
#' The overall model takes the following form:
#'
#' log(P(Y = k | X)/P(Y = 1 | X)) = mu_k + phi_k*beta_vec^T x_vec
#'
#' for k = 2, ..., q, where x_vec is the vector of covariates for the
#' observation Y.
#'
#' mu_1 is fixed at 0 for identifiability of the model, and the phi_k parameters
#' are constrained to be ordered (giving the model its name) in the following
#' way:
#'
#' 0 = phi_1 <= phi_2 <= ... <= phi_k <= ... <= phi_q = 1.
#'
#' (The unordered stereotype model restricts phi_1 and phi_q but allows the
#' remaining phi_k to be in any order, and this is suitable for fitting the
#' model for nominal data. However, this package does not provide that option,
#' as it is already available in other packages which can fit the stereotype
#' model.)
#'
#' After fitting the model, the estimated values of the intermediate phi_k
#' values indicate a suitable numerical spacing of the ordinal response
#' categories that is based on the data. The spacings indicate how much distinct
#' information each of the corresponding levels provide. For example, if you
#' have five response categories and the fitted phi values are \code{(0, 0.04,
#' 0.6, 0.62, 1)} then this indicates that levels 1 and 2 provide very similar
#' information about the effect of the covariates on the response, and levels 3
#' and 4 provide very similar information as each other. The meaning of this is
#' that you could simplify the response by combining levels 1 and 2 and
#' combining levels 3 and 4 (i.e. reduce the levels to 1, 3 and 5) and you would
#' still be able to estimate the beta coefficients with similar accuracy.
#'
#' Another use for the phi_k values is that if you want to carry out further
#' analysis of the response, treating it as a numerical variable, then the phi
#' values are a better choice of numerical values for the response categories
#' than the default values 1 to q.
#'
#' \strong{\code{start}} argument values: \code{start} is a vector of start
#' values for estimating the model parameters.
#'
#' The first part of the \code{start} vector is starting values for the
#' coefficients of the covariates, the second part is starting values for the mu
#' values (per-category intercepts), and the third part is starting values for
#' the raw parameters used to construct the phi values.
#'
#' The length of the vector is [number of covariate terms] + [number of
#' categories in response variable - 1] + [number of categories in response
#' variable - 2]. Every one of the values can take any real value.
#'
#' The second part is the starting values for the mu_k per-category intercept
#' parameters, and since mu_1 is fixed at 0 for identifiability, the number of
#' non-fixed mu_k parameters is one fewer than the number of categories.
#'
#' The third part of the starting vector is a re-parametrization used to
#' construct starting values for the estimated phi parameters such that the phi
#' parameters observe the ordering restriction of the ordered stereotype model,
#' but the raw parameters are not restricted which makes it easier to optimise
#' over them. phi_1 is always 0 and phi_q is always 1 (where q is the number of
#' response categories). If the raw parameters are u_2 up to u_(q-1), then phi_2
#' is constructed as expit(u_2), phi_3 is expit(u_2 + exp(u_3)), phi_4 is
#' expit(exp(u_3) + exp(u_4)) etc. which ensures that the phi_k values are
#' non-decreasing.
