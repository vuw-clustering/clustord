\title{Calculate comparison measures between two sets of clustering results}
\usage{
calc.cluster.comparisons(ppr1, ppr2)
}
\arguments{
\item{ppr1}{Posterior probabilities of cluster membership, named \code{ppr_m}
or \code{ppc_m} in the output of \code{\link{clustord}}. If you have
performed biclustering, then \code{ppr1} should be the clustering results
for just one of the dimensions i.e. just the row clustering results, or
just the column clustering results. The rows of \code{ppr1} give the
entries that have been clustered, and each column corresponds to one
cluster.}

\item{ppr2}{Posterior probabilities of cluster membership from a different
clustering run, which will be compared to \code{ppr1}.}
}
\value{
A list with components:

    \code{ARI}: Adjusted Rand Index.

    \code{NVI}: Normalised Variation of Information.

    \code{NID}: Normalised Information Distance.
}
\description{
Given two sets of posterior probabilities of membership for clusters,
calculate three measures to compare the clustering memberships.
}
\details{
The three measures are the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), the Normalised
Variation of Information (NVI) and the Normalised Information Distance (NID).

The three measures are documented in
