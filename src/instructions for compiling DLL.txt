Instructions for compiling Daniel's C code into a .dll

1) Already have Rtools installed, navigate to the folder containing the mingw executable: C:\RBuildTools\3.5\mingw_64\bin

2) Go to C:\Program Files\R\R-3.5.2\ and copy the "include" folder and all of its contents into wherever you've got Daniel's .c code.

3) Go to Windows Search, type "cmd", and then right click on the command prompt icon and select "run as Administrator".
Then you need to type "D:" to change to the D drive ("cd D:\" doesn't work for changing drives).
Navigate to the folder containing the .c file and the "include folder.

4) Run the first command, which includes the full path to the gcc compiler:

>> C:\RBuildTools\3.5\mingw_64\bin\gcc -c -Iinclude -DBUILDING_EXAMPLE_DLL EMfuncsStereotype_in_C.c

(or on Windows laptop, running more recent version of Windows, 10,
>> C:\Rtools\mingw_64\bin\gcc -c -Iinclude -DBUILDING_EXAMPLE_DLL EMfuncsStereotype_in_C.c)

5) Run the second command, which again includes the full path to the gcc compiler:

>> C:\RBuildTools\3.5\mingw_64\bin\gcc -shared -o EMfuncsStereotype_in_C.dll EMfuncsStereotype_in_C.o -Wl,--out-implib,EMfuncsStereotype_in_C.a

Note that the "--Wl" option is W<<L>>, not W<<one>>.
(Again change the path to Rtools for laptop.)
